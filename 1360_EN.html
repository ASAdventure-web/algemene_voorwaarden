<h3 id="xx_page-title">19. Right of withdrawal</h3>

<div class="xx_content_txt">
<p>You have the right to withdraw from the agreement within a period of 14 days without indicating the reasons.<br />
<br />
The right of withdrawal expires after 14 days you or a third party appointed by you, other than the carrier, takes physical possession of the last batch or article.<br />
<br />
In order to exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform <strong>A.S.Adventure, Smallandlaan 9, 2660 Hoboken, 0032(0)3/825.20.00, team@asadventure.com </strong>about your intention to withdraw from this agreement, through explicit declaration (e.g. through mail, fax or email). For this purpose, you can use the <a href="http://webpoint.asadventure.com/contentpages/STANDARD%20WITHDRAWAL%20FORM.pdf" target="_blank">standard withdrawal form annexed herein</a>, but this is not mandatory.<br />
<br />
In order to comply with the withdrawal term, please send the notice relative to your decision to exercise the right of withdrawal before the right of withdrawal period expires.<br />
<br />
<strong>Effects of withdrawal</strong><br />
If you decide to withdraw from the agreement that was previously made, we will refund all the payments that you have made, including the delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs in case you chose a type of delivery other than the least expensive standard delivery method offered by A.S.Adventure), without any undue delay and in any case no longer than 14 days after we were informed about your decision to withdraw from the agreement. We will make refunds by using the same payment method that was initially chosen for the transaction, unless explicitly agreed otherwise. In any case, you will not incur any cost, as consequence of said refund.<br />
<br />
We have the right to wait to refund you until we have received all returned purchases, or until you have proven that you have shipped all purchases for withdrawal, according to which date occurs first.<br />
<br />
You have to return the goods or submit them without undue delays and in any case, within 14 days from the day you notified us your intention to withdraw from this agreement. The term is respected if you return the goods prior to the expiry of the 14-day term.</p>
