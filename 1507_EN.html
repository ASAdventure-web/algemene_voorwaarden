<div class="xx_content_txt">
<p>These rules describe the conditions for submitting or using customer reviews on our website. The rules supplement the terms and conditions of use for our website and our privacy policy and apply to all users of our website.</p>

<p>When you submit a review, you automatically accept all terms and conditions of these rules and agree to comply with them.</p>
</div>

<h4>a.&nbsp; Guidelines</h4>

<div class="xx_content_txt">
<p>We believe it is important that our customers receive all the information they need to make informed decisions about our products. We encourage all customers who have bought a product to share their experiences with others. We ask them however to follow these simple guidelines:</p>

<p><strong>Your review must:</strong></p>

<ul class="xx_list-simple">
	<li>represent your honest opinion, regardless of whether this is positive or negative;</li>
	<li>be correct as regards the stated facts;</li>
	<li>be relevant &ndash; focus on specific properties of a product and your experience with it;</li>
	<li>be concise - the number of characters is not limited, but we advise you to keep your review to 300 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>On the other hand it is not permitted:</strong></p>

<ul class="xx_list-simple">
	<li>to post obscene, tasteless, insulting or hateful reviews;</li>
	<li>to slander or provoke others;</li>
	<li>to impersonate someone else or to provide a false identity;</li>
	<li>to state the name, contact details or other personal details of another person;</li>
	<li>to include advertising or publicity material or links to other websites in your review;</li>
	<li>to include material created by someone else or to infringe another person&#39;s rights in your review;</li>
	<li>to give details about prices or availability in your review;</li>
	<li>to comment on another customer review.</li>
	<li>These guidelines apply to every customer review and must be complied with according to the letter and spirit. We will decide at our discretion whether a customer review infringes these guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h4>b. How we may use your customer review</h4>

<div class="xx_content_txt">
<p>You retain copyright to a customer review which you submit on our website. But when you submit a review:</p>

<ul class="xx_list-simple">
	<li>you grant us the right to make free use of, amend, adapt, reproduce, publish and disseminate your customer review. This permission is free of charge and in perpetuity and can be passed on to third parties under sub-licence at our own discretion;</li>
	<li>you warrant that you wrote the review yourself, that it is not fully or largely copied from other material and that it does not infringe the aforementioned guidelines;</li>
	<li>you renounce any moral or similar rights you may have to your customer review, insofar as this is legally permitted.<br />
	<br />
	The rights you grant us in relation to any customer review whatsoever that you place on our website imply (without restriction) that we are at liberty to publish your review in full or in part, even if you change your opinion and you request us to remove it; and also to remove or process it, even if it does not entail any infringement of our guidelines; and to use it in connection with the promotion or announcement of products and services on our website.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h4>c. Infringements of our rules and guidelines</h4>

<div class="xx_content_txt">
<p>We reserve the right - at our discretion - to refuse, remove or modify a customer review, if we are of the view that it infringes these rules. We expressly reject any liability for any loss or harm arising from the use of customer reviews by any person whatsoever contrary to these rules.</p>

<p>If we are of the view that these rules have been infringed, we may take suitable action at our discretion. Any failure to comply with these rules is a material breach of the user conditions that allow you to use our website and may result in one or all of the following actions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="xx_list-simple">
	<li>immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use our website;</li>
	<li>immediate, temporary or permanent removal of customer reviews you have already submitted on our website;</li>
	<li>a warning sent to you;</li>
	<li>legal steps against you for repayment of all costs (including but not limited to our reasonable administrative and legal costs) arising from the infringement;</li>
	<li>further legal steps against you; and</li>
	<li>handing over this information to law enforcement agencies if we consider this reasonably necessary or are legally obliged to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reject any liability for measures we may take in response to infringements of these rules. These measures are not limited to the above list and we are at liberty to take all other measures that we consider reasonably necessary.</p>
